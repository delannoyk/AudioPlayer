AudioPlayer is a wrapper around AVPlayer. It also offers cool features such as:
* Quality control based on number of interruption (buffering) and time delay
* Retry if player fails
* Connection handling
* Audio item enqueuing
* Player mode (Repeat, Repeat all, Suffle)
* MPNowPlayingInfoCenter
* A high level of customization

## Installation

* CocoaPods: `pod 'KDEAudioPlayer'`
* Carthage: `github "delannoyk/AudioPlayer"`

## Usage
### Basics
```swift
let delegate: AudioPlayerDelegate = ...

let player = AudioPlayer()
player.delegate = delegate
let item = AudioItem(mediumQualitySoundURL: track.streamURL)
player.playItem(item)
```

### Delegate
In order to alert about status change or other events, AudioPlayer uses delegation.

#### State
When AudioPlayer’s state changes, the method
```swift
func audioPlayer(audioPlayer: AudioPlayer, didChangeStateFrom from: AudioPlayerState, toState to: AudioPlayerState)
```
is called.

#### Duration & progression
When AudioPlayer’s current item found duration of its content
```swift
func audioPlayer(audioPlayer: AudioPlayer, didFindDuration duration: NSTimeInterval, forItem item: AudioItem)
```
is called.

This method is called regularly to notify progression update.
```swift
func audioPlayer(audioPlayer: AudioPlayer, didUpdateProgressionToTime time: NSTimeInterval, percentageRead: Float)
```
`percentageRead` is a Float value between 0 & 100 so that you can easily update an UISlider for example.

#### Queue
```swift
func audioPlayer(audioPlayer: AudioPlayer, willStartPlayingItem item: AudioItem)
```

### Control Center / Lockscreen
```swift
func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {
    application.beginReceivingRemoteControlEvents()
}

//Then in your UIResponder (or your AppDelegate if you will)
override func remoteControlReceivedWithEvent(event: UIEvent?) {
    if let event = event {
        yourPlayer.remoteControlReceivedWithEvent(event)
    }
}
```
